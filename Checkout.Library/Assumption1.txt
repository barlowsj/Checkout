Products can not have both order together promotions and order quantity promotions.

Order together promotions will always be percentage based and only one is allowed per product.

Order quantity will always be a fixed price for bulk purchases and only one is allowed per product.

The basket total only needs calculating once all items have been added and not after each item is added as the kata says "Items have been added..."
